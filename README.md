# Hi, I'm Krishnan 👋

I'm a **MERN stack learner** who’s focused on understanding how the web actually works — from the browser to the database.

I believe in learning by **building real projects**, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly getting better at writing clean, understandable code.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- **JavaScript** (core language, async behavior, promises)
- **Node.js** & **Express.js** (backend logic, APIs)
- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** (databases, data modeling)
- **React** (component-based UI, state, hooks)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control, collaboration workflows)

---

## 🛠️ How I Learn

- Build small → break → debug → improve  
- Focus on fundamentals before frameworks  
- Prefer projects over tutorials  
- Try to understand *why* something works, not just *how*

---

## 📂 Projects

I’m actively working on:
- Backend applications
- Authentication & authorization flows
- Full-stack MERN projects
- Improving code structure and readability
- Interactive REACT frontend for robust UI/UX

> Each project reflects my current level — progress matters more than perfection.

---

## 🎯 Current Goal

Become a **confident full-stack web developer** by mastering the MERN stack fundamentals and writing production-ready code.
